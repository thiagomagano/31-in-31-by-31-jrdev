# 02. Counting the Number of Characters

Create a program that prompts for an input string and displays output that shows the input string and the number of characters the string contains

## Example output

```bash
What is the input string? Homer
Homer has 5 Characters
```

## Constraints

- Be Sure the output contains the original string
- Use a single output statement to construct the output
- Use a bult-in function of the programming language to determine the length of the string.

## Analises

input: String
process: Count Number of Strings
output: Number of caracter da Strings

## Test Cases

Input: Homer
Expected: 5

## Pseudocode

```

String word = leia("What is the input string?)

int wordCount = word.size()

console("%s has %d characters", word, wordCount)
```

## Extra Challenges

- [x] User must type sommenthing
- [x] A GUI version
