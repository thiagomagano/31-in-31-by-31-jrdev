# 01. Saying Hello

>The “Hello, World” program is the first program you learn to write in many languages, but it doesn’t involve any input. So create a program that prompts for your name and prints a greeting using your name.

## Example Output

```bash
Whats is your name? Brian
Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!
```

- **Input*: name
- **Process**: Concat the name with the de message.
- **Output**: greetingsMessage

## Test Cases

```
Input:
	name: Brian
Expected Result:
	"Hello, Brian, nice to meet you"
```

## Pseudocode

```pseudocode
String name = prompt("Whats is your name? ")

print("Hello, ${name}, nice to meet you")
```

## Extra Challenges

- [ ] Version with no variables
- [x] Version of multi greetings
