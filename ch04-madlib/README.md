# Mad Lib

Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result. 

Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.

## Example Output

```console
Enter a noun: dog 
Enter a verb: walk 
Enter an adjective: blue 
Enter an adverb: quickly 
Do you *walk* your *blue* *dog* *quickly*? That's hilarious!

```
